		<p>
			I am an enthusiastic Front-end Developer based in the Netherlands with a passion for creating
			user-friendly and inclusive web experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
			After completing the Application Development program at the ROC of Amsterdam, I started the
			Business IT & Management program at Windesheim while working part-time as a full-stack
			developer. During this time, I found myself increasingly drawn to front-end development.
			Realizing this was where my true passion lay, I decided to leave my program at Windesheim and
			search for something more aligned with my interests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thatâ€™s when I discovered the Front-end Design & Development program at the Amsterdam
			University of Applied Sciences. I applied, and everything clicked. I found myself enjoying
			school like never before and eventually graduated cum laude. Just before my final assessment,
			I received the exciting news that my internship would turn into a job offer.
		</p>
		<p>
			I gladly accepted, and now, I work full-time as a Front-end Developer at the Voorhoede in
			Amsterdam, doing what I love every day.
